## v0.1.0 Foundation

The main goal of this version is to get a playable game with a complete loop around resource extraction, enemy attacks and playing cards.

### Card Play

#### Frist Draw

Start the game. Choose the cards you want to keep from a list of 5, put the rest back into the deck, shuffle and draw until you have 5.

#### Preparation Time

A period before the first wave. You can play as many cards as the resources allow you.

#### Wave Starts

At the beginning of the wave, draw cards until you have 5.

#### Wave Ends

At the end of the wave, choose a card from a list of 3 and add it to your deck.

### Food

People need food to work. Each person and some structures require an amount of food every once in a while; without it they won't perform as usual.
